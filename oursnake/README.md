snake game with hunter! in these game you play 1v1, hunter with WASD, snake with arrows. 
The snake has to run from the hunter and the hunter has to catch the snake. 
The snake will gain length with time and can shed his body if longer >= 3 by pressing RSHIFT? (or SPACE) i dont remember, and this will create wall blocks that the hunter takes a little to break.
Eventually the walls will break slowly as time passes to avoid overfilling the game map with walls.
During the game some powerups spawn for both hunter and snake, that lasts for a while.
Hunter can become bigger and break all the walls connected to the one he smash into with just 1 hit, snake can become venomous (red) and at that point catch the hunter who has to run from him or just acquire a rattle tail that hurts the hunter if the hunter catches the tail.
To win, the snake has to arrive to the end of the 4 seasons (4 stages) of the game, each one characterized by an increasing difficulty for the snake. This creates sort of a hurry in the hunter to catch him as soon as possible, and to the snake to run towards the end, which get harder and harder.
Both the snake and the hunter can pass to the next season by passing through warps that spawns randomly as powerups does, but with decreased probability.

Summer is plain, no added difficulty, being the first season, to make both player learn the game.
Fall add rain as an event: the more it's raining the more slippery and darker it get: for both players! Watch out to not trap yourself while moving as slippery means that the direction you go cant not be the one pressed with the KEYBOARD. You can slip!
Winter add snow and wind. The map shakes in a snowstorm occluding visibility and moving everything around.
Spring is when the nature takes his revenge: bushes (walls) start growing from the bottom of the screen as climbing plants and from the walls left by the snake. After a while the game map become REALLY messy!

Have fun!
