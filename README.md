# (py)games

Just a repo containing three games I written using pygame during high school in a boringness moment. It features three classics: snake, pong and space invaders... with some added spicyness
1) Snake is.. with teleports! The more you go far in the game the more warps spawns, the harder it becomes figuring out where you will pop-out!
2) Pong is playable with WASD on the left and arrows on the right, and features a whole set of powerups (or downs) that makes the game more rich.
3) Space invaders is my best product: it mixes a lot of things i like: it's a visual beaty (in my opinion), it features 5 different weapons, different levels, powerups, cool pixelized-animations and randomness. P.S. I love how the flamethrower and the "being hit" effects got out, all thanks to randomness.
