# (py)games

Just a repo containing some games I written using pygame during high school in a boringness moment. It features three classics: snake, pong and space invaders... with some added spicyness
1) Snake is.. with teleports! The more you go far in the game the more warps spawns, the harder it becomes figuring out where you will pop-out!
2) Pong is playable with WASD on the left and arrows on the right, and features a whole set of powerups (or downs) that makes the game more rich.
3) Space invaders is my best piece: it mixes a lot of things i like: it's a visual beauty (in my opinion), it features 5 different weapons, different levels, powerups, cool pixelized-animations and randomness. P.S. I love how the flamethrower and the "being hit" effects got out, all thanks to randomness.

and...

4) Isometric! Explore, dig, build, and survive in the Archipelago!
    Step into an isometric world of procedurally generated islands and caves, with day and night cycles, nature that changes with seasons, sun shadows, weather like rain and snow, and BEAUTIFULLY harmonic sea waves. Everything is purely realized using ONLY simple geometric shapes, randomicity and MATH :)
   Gather resources like wood, stone, and minerals to build houses, towers and bridges. Navigate from island to island by byilding a boat and sail! But watch out the wind! You can only go where you desire if the wind is your friend!
   Manage your inventory, and uncover hidden secrets across the upper and the underworld.
   P.S: this is not really a game (in the sense that there's not a clear purpose) but more like an experiment of a lot of different mechanics typical of exploration and survival games.
